Creating a comprehensive README file for a GitHub repository is essential for explaining the purpose, structure, and usage of your project, especially for a data analysis project like a COVID-19 portfolio project. Below is a template that you can adapt for your specific project:

# COVID-19 Data Analysis Portfolio Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact globally, focusing on cases, deaths, and vaccination rates. Utilizing datasets from Our World in Data, the project analyzes various metrics to understand the pandemic's dynamics across different regions and timeframes.

### Data Source

The primary dataset used in this project is obtained from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), which compiles comprehensive COVID-19 data covering confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across countries and continents.

## Analysis Highlights

The project covers several key analyses:

- **Trends of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths**: Analysis of total cases and deaths over time to identify trends and patterns.
- **Vaccination Progress**: Evaluation of vaccination rates in relation to the population, highlighting the progress towards herd immunity.
- **Impact by Continent**: Comparative analysis of how different continents have been affected by and responded to the pandemic.
- **Country-Specific Insights**: Detailed analysis focusing on specific countries, including case fatality rates and infection rates per capita.

## Key SQL Queries

1. **Total Cases vs. Total Deaths**: Calculates the death percentage to assess the fatality rate of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia.
    ```sql
    SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
    FROM CovidDeaths
    WHERE location LIKE '%saudi%'
    AND continent IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY 1,2;
    ```

2. **Population vs. Vaccination**: Determines the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID vaccine dose.
    ```sql
    -- Using CTE
    WITH PopvsVac AS (
        SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
        SUM(CONVERT(bigint, vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.Location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.Date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
        FROM CovidDeaths dea
        JOIN CovidVaccinations vac ON dea.location = vac.location AND dea.date = vac.date
        WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL
    )
    SELECT *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100
    FROM PopvsVac;
    ```
